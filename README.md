# Cart Shelf Bracket
3D printable bracket to adjust the height and easily remove a shelf on a steel bar cart. This design is specific to the cart and magnets I bought. Primarily using this repo as a test for FreeCAD files.

Goal was to move the middle shelf of the cart higher to accomodate a gas bottle for my BBQ on the bottom shelf. I didn't particularly want to drill new holes into the cart and wanted a neat solution that made me more familiar with FreeCAD.
